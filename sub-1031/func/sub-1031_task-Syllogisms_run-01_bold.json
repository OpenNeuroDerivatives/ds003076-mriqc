    "TaskDescription": "This task contained 54 trials of a deductive reasoning task divided into two runs, entitled task-Syllogisms_run-01 and task-Syllogisms_run-02. In each experimental trial participants were visually presented with a set-inclusion problem describing a series of relationships among 3 classes, containing three premises and a conclusion. In each argument, the first class was a monosyllabic psuedoword that was different in each problem. The second and third classes were one of sixteen adjectives: tall, short, big, small, old, young, fast, slow, brown, red, black, blue, green, white, pink. In each problem, the first class was included in the second class in the first premise and the third class was included in the first class in the second premise. The third premise of problem characterized an imaginary character as belonging to one of the classes. Half of the conclusions of the problems required the integration of all three premises and half required the integration of only two premises. In addition, some conclusions included a negation to make conclusions less predictable. This amounted to 36 problems organized into four groups; 18 true and affirmative problems (true_affirm), 6 false and affirmative problems (false_affirm), 6 true with negation problems (true_negate), and 6 false with negation problems (false_negate). Each group was further split into those requiring 2 premises to make the judgment and those requiring 3 premises to make the judgement, denoted by a number preceding the validity in the condition name (i.e. 2_true_affirm), for a total of eight conditions. An example of a valid and affirmative problem necessitating the integration of two premises was: (1) All blons are pink, (2) All pink things are young, (3) Ken is a blon, (C) Ken is pink. Premises and the conclusion were presented one at time, with the next premise appearing below the last (first premise at 0 s, second at 2 s, third at 4 s, and conclusion at 6 s). Premises were presented in grey text while the conclusion was presented in black text to make it clear that a judgment had to be made. Once presented with the conclusion, participants were given 6 s to press one of two buttons to judge the validity of the conclusion given the premises. The trial continued as soon as participants provided a response or after 6 s had passed a red asterisk appeared below the conclusion for 2 s to indicate that no response had been made. At the end of each trial, a jittered red fixation cross was presented on the screen for 2.8-3.6s. The task also included 18 null trials to serve as a baseline correction. In these trials participants were presented with a blue cross on the screen for 2.8-3.6s followed by a red cross for 2.8-3.6 s and were asked to press with their first finger when they saw a blue cross, participants could respond as soon as they saw the blue cross and until it turned red. The trial would continue to the red cross as soon as the participant responded. Each run ended with the presentation of a black fixation cross for 10 s.",
